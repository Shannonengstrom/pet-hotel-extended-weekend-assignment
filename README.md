Questions for Mary or Dev: 
[] delete for pets: 
- Was working Monday morning and then it broke after Josh and I were trying to fix my PUT.
[] PUT has never worked. Same issue as I'm having with my DELETE. I have it working server side but it is not updating the DOM. It is grabbing the ID. 
[] How would I only delete owners when they have 0 pets?

Let me know if you need more details!
